        "answer": "What is it?: \r\n\r\nSnakesNearYou that allows you to see what snakes other people are finding in a given area. This is meant to help you find target species you have been eying, as well as checking density and whether a spot is worth going too.\r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n\r\nFirst we need to select coordinates, while you can input your own. The simple way to select coordinates is to simply double click anywhere on the map. You will see a red pin drop, and the coordinate fields will autofill based on where you dropped the pin \r\n\r\nSecond you need to enter a radius, this is the distance from the pin our website will search for observations in. For ease of use the distance in is miles. For speed and usability we have a max radius of twenty miles.\r\n\r\nThird select a time range for the observations, if you only want recent observations select 6 months. If you want to see options further back select a larger time range.\r\n\r\nFinally click the find observations button to finalize your search. (It may take a few seconds to load)\r\n\r\nIf the website found any observations you will see them pop up as pins on the map! To find out more information about the observation simply click it's pin and a window of details will pop up above it.",
