The northern pine snake is a state threatened species found in the Pine Barrens of NJ.  It is limited to sandy habitat as it burrows underground for shelter and egg laying.  It is a large snake with white, gray, or cream ground coloration marked with black or dark brown blotches. The blotches are more clearly defined towards the tail of the snake. They have keeled scales. The pine snake will hiss and defend itself vigorously when threatened and can inflict a painful, non-venomous bite if handled. The pine snake climbs trees readily but spends a considerable amount of time burrowing.

This is NJ’s largest snake.  Like the black racer, the black rat is common throughout the state in rural and semi-suburban areas and is found in very similar habitats.  The adult black rat is a long, plain black snake with a white chin and throat and a white or pale yellow belly.  It is a slightly more bulky snake than the racer and when the skin is distended, some skin between the scales may appear white. Juvenile black rats are commonly misidentified as timber rattlesnakes as they have a gray ground color with dark brown or gray blotches on the back. They have weakly keeled scales.

Common throughout the state in rural and semi-suburban areas, the black racer can be found in fields or woodlands, and occasionally around residential gardens. The adult black racer is a long, slender, fast black snake with a white chin and throat. Juvenile black racers are commonly misidentified as timber rattlesnakes as they have a gray ground color with dark brown or gray blotches on the back with smaller spots on the sides. The pattern fades and the ground color becomes darker with age. They have smooth scales. Black racers mimic rattlesnakes by vibrating their tails on leaves and grass when they are threatened. Black racers will eat newborn rattlesnakes as well as other wildlife, and may climb trees to access bird nestlings for food. They are rather defensive snakes that frequently inflict a painful, non-venomous bite when handled.
